% Purpose		This routine interpolates over a tetrahedral tessellation, that has been transferred
%				from an RGB domain, to a codomain in CIE (or other) coordinates.
%
% Description	This routine was intended as part of an algorithm that identifies RGB triples that,
%				when printed (and viewed under a known illuminant), have a desired set of CIE
%				coordinates.  The input data consist of a set of RGB triples, their corresponding
%				CIE coordinates when printed, and a set of CIE aimpoints, for which RGB triples are
%				desired.  The routine first calculates a tetrahedral tessellation of the RGB
%				triples.  (The write-up "How to Print a Munsell Book" describes why the RGB data
%				should be tessellated, rather than the CIE coordinates.)  The tessellation is a
%				four-column matrix that lists four vertices for each tetrahedron; a vertex is an
%				RGB triple.  The RGB vertices are automatically indexed, in the order in which
%				they are input.  The RGB tessellation can be formally transferred to a CIE tessellation.  As long as
%				the RGB-CIE mapping is fairly regular, the new tessellation will in fact be valid, in
%				that it will contain no overlapping tetrahedra.  
%
%				A given CIE aimpoint is localized by identifying which tetrahedron of the tessellation
%				it belongs to, and where in that tetrahedron it is.  The location within a tetrahedron is
%				expressed in barycentric coordinates, while the tetrahedron itself is given by an
%				index.  The index and barycentric coordinates can apply equally well to RGB or CIE
%				coordinates, so an interpolated RGB value can be calculated.  When printed, this RGB
%				should be closer to the desired CIE coordinates than any of the input RGBs.
%
%				It is possible that the CIE aimpoint is outside the gamut of the input CIE points.  In
%				that case, flag values of -99 are used for many of the returned variables.
%
% Syntax		InterpolateForAimPoints(RGB, xyY, AimPoints);
%
%				RGB					A three-column matrix of RGB triples
%
%				xyY					A three-column matrix of CIE coordinates, which correspond to the
%									RGB triples.  The CIE coordinates are written here as "xyY," but could
%									be any kind of CIE coordinates, such as XYZ or Lab.
%
%				AimPoints			A three-column matrix of aimpoints, in the same CIE coordinates as xyY
%
%				InterpolatedRGB		A three-column matrix, the same size as AimPoints, that contains an RGB
%									triple for the corresponding CIE aimpoint
%
%				RGBvertices			A structure of matrices.  Each matrix lists the four RGB triples that
%									make up the vertices of the tetrahedron that contains an aimpoint
%									interpolation
%
%				xyzvertices			A similar structure to RGB vertices, but in CIE space
%
%				AllBaryCoords		A structure with the barycentric coordinates of the interpolated aimpoints
%
%				tessellation		A four-column matrix giving a tetrahedral Delaunay tessellation of
%									the input RGB data
