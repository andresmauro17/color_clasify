% Purpose		Convert the Munsell renotation data into three MATLAB matrices.
%
% Description	The Munsell system specifies a local colour by giving its hue (H), value (V),
%				and chroma(C) in the form HV/C.  The value is a number between 0 and 10,
%				although for practical purposes value usually ranges only from 1 to 9.  
%				The chroma is a positive number, whose bound depends on hue and value,
%				as given by the MacAdam limits.  The hue specification consists of a letter
%				designator (B, BG, G, GY, Y, YR, R, RP, P, PB), and a number designator 
%				which is greater than 0, and less than or equal to 10.  If chroma is
%				0, then the local colour has no hue, and is specified as NV, where N is the
%				string "N," and V is the value.  For example, 5.6R8.2/4.1 is a light pastel
%				red, while N3 is a dark grey.
%
%				The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) uses a different system
%				for specifying colours.  In their system, standardized in 1931,
%				a coloured light source is specified by three coordinates: x, y, and Y.
%				The coordinate Y gives a colour's luminance, or relative luminance.  
%				When interpreted as a
%				relative luminance, as will be done here, Y is a number between 0 and
%				100, that expresses the intensity of the source as a percentage of some
%				maximum intensity.  This percentage is calculated with regard to the
%				human photopic luminous efficiency function, which has been established
%				as part of the CIE 2 degree standard observer.  When dealing with
%				physical samples such as paints, Y is the percentage of a fixed light
%				source that a paint sample reflects (with regard to the standard 
%				observer).  
%
%				The coordinates x and y are chromaticity coordinates.  While Y
%				indicates, roughly speaking, how light or dark a colour is, x and y
%				indicate hue and chroma.  For example, the colour might be saturated red,
%				or a dull green.  The CIE chromaticity diagram ([Foley1990, Sect. 13.2.2]) 
%				displays all chromaticities that are possible for a light source of a fixed
%				luminance, when	the light source is viewed in isolation.  
%
%				There is a conceptual difficulty in converting between Munsell specifications
%				and CIE coordinates.  The difficulty occurs because the Munsell system
%				applies to local colours, which are defined by spectral reflectance
%				functions, and CIE coordinates apply to coloured lights, which are defined
%				by spectral power distributions (SPD).  The 1943 Munsell renotation ([Newhall1943])
%				bridged this gap by fixing Illuminant C as a light source,
%				that illuminates the local colour.  The local colour is specified in the
%				Munsell system, and the light reflecting off the local colour is analyzed
%				in terms of CIE coordinates.  The Y value is the percentage of light,
%				originally of an Illuminant C SPD, that the local colour reflects, 
%				measured in terms of the CIE standard observer.  The x and y chromaticity
%				coordinates can be found for the reflected light.
%
%				The Munsell renotation went further, by using assessments from 40 human
%				observers of Munsell hue, value, and chroma.  The results of these assessments
%				were averaged, to express xyY coordinates as smooth functions of 
%				Munsell samples.  The renotation used samples from the 1929 Munsell Book of
%				Color, and recommended some changes, summarized in Table III of 
%				[Newhall1943].  For example, the 1929 sample 2.5R8/4 was renotated to
%				2.0R7.8/3.1.  The 1943 Munsell renotation is a standard today, and supersedes
%				previous versions of the Munsell system.
%
%				The conversion data for the Munsell renotation was originally given as 
%				a look-up table, expressing a Munsell specification in xyY coordinates
%				([Newhall1943, Table I]).  Grey values were not included in this table;
%				according to ([Newhall1943, p. 386]), the xy coordinates of any neutral grey
%				are the xy coordinates of the white point of Illuminant C.  
%				The renotation matrices made by the current routine include all the data
%				from ([Newhall1943, Table I]), and augment it with data for greys.
%
%				This routine makes three data matrices (xRen, yRen, and YRen), one for
%				each of x, y, and Y.   The three matrices
%				give the x, y, and Y coordinates for the Munsell renotations.  Each matrix is
%				triply indexed.  The three indices,
%				which are identical for each matrix, are HueIndex, Value Index, and Chroma Index.
%
%				HueIndex goes from 0 to 41, corresponding to Munsell hues, as follows:
%					1 2.5R	 |	 9 2.5Y  |	17 2.5G  |	25 2.5B  |	33 2.5P  |	41 N
%					2 5R	 |	10 5Y	 |	18 5G    |	26 5B    |	34 5P    |
%					3 7.5R	 |	11 7.5Y	 |	19 7.5G  |	27 7.5B  |	35 7.5P  |
%					4 10R	 |	12 10Y   |	20 10G   |	28 10B   |	36 10P   |
%					5 2.5YR |	13 2.5GY |	21 2.5BG |	29 2.5PB |	37 2.5RP |
%					6 5YR	 |	14 5GY   |	22 5BG   |	30 5PB   |	38 5RP   |
%					7 7.5YR |	15 7.5GY |	23 7.5BG |	31 7.5PB |	39 7.5RP |
%					8 10YR	 |	16 10GY  |	24 10BG  |	32 10PB  |	40 10RP  |
%				In addition to chromatic colours, neutral greys are given a hue index of 41.
%
%				ValueIndex runs from 1 to 9, and is equal to the Munsell value.
%
%				ChromaIndex runs from 1 to 19, and is half the Munsell chroma.  Greys, whose
%				chroma is 0, are assigned a ChromaIndex of 20.
%
%				For any Munsell hue
%				and value, there is a maximum chroma, called the MacAdam limit.  Colours whose
%				chromas are greater than the MacAdam limit do not correspond to any human visual
%				phenomenon.  The three matrices	contain entries of NaN for Munsell specifications
%				that are beyond the MacAdam limits.
%
%				The three matrices are combined as fields of a structure, named 
%				RenotationMatrices.  This routine saves that structure in a .mat file, for use
%				by other ColorLab routines.
%
%				The Munsell renotation data is freely available for download as text files,
%				from the Munsell Color Science Laboratory ([MCSL2010]).  The downloaded file,
%				real.dat, has been saved as MunsellRenotation.txt, which is read in by the 
%				current routine.  A description was added at the head of the file.  In June
%				2010, it was discovered that 5 lines that occurred in Table I from
%				[Newhall1943] were missing in real.dat.  Those 5 lines have been added to
%				MunsellRenotation.txt.  The Munsell Color Science Laboratory was alerted, and 
%				is adding the 5 lines to their file, real.dat.
