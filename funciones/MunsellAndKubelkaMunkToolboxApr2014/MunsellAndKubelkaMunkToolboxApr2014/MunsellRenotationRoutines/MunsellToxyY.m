function [x y Y Status] = MunsellToxyY(MunsellSpec);
% Purpose		Convert a Munsell specification into xyY coordinates, by interpolating
%				over the extrapolated Munsell renotation data.  Because extrapolated data
%				are used, this routine might return xyY coordinates even when MunsellSpec
%				is beyond the MacAdam limits.
%
% Description	The Munsell system specifies a local colour by giving its hue (H), value (V),
%				and chroma (C), in the form HV/C.  The value is a number between 0 and 10.  
%				The chroma is a positive number, whose bound depends on hue and value,
%				as given by the MacAdam limits.  The hue specification consists of a letter
%				designator (B, BG, G, GY, Y, YR, R, RP, P, PB), and a number designator 
%				which is greater than 0, and less than or equal to 10.  If chroma is
%				0, then the local colour has no hue, and is specified as NV, where N is the
%				string "N," and V is the value.  For example, 5.0R9.0/4.0 is a light pastel
%				red, while N3 is a dark grey.
%
%				The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) uses a different system
%				for specifying colours.  In their system, standardized in 1931,
%				a coloured light source is specified by three coordinates: x, y, and Y.
%				The coordinate Y gives a colour's luminance factor, or relative luminance.  
%				When expressed as a number between 0 and
%				100, Y is the intensity of the source as a percentage of some
%				maximum intensity.  This percentage is calculated with regard to the
%				human photopic luminous efficiency function, which has been established
%				as part of the CIE 2 degree standard observer.  When dealing with
%				physical samples such as paints, Y is the percentage of a fixed light
%				source that a paint sample reflects (with regard to the standard 
%				observer).  
%
%				The coordinates x and y are chromaticity coordinates.  While Y
%				indicates how light or dark a colour is, x and y
%				indicate hue and chroma.  For example, the colour might be saturated red,
%				or a dull green.  The CIE chromaticity diagram ([Foley1990, Sect. 13.2.2]) displays 
%				all chromaticities that are possible for physical samples of a fixed
%				luminance factor.
%
%				There is a conceptual difficulty in converting between Munsell specifications
%				and CIE coordinates.  The difficulty occurs because the Munsell system
%				applies to local colours, which are defined by spectral reflectance
%				functions, and CIE coordinates apply to coloured lights, which are defined
%				by spectral power distributions (SPD).  The 1943 Munsell renotation ([Newhall1943])
%				bridged this gap by fixing Illuminant C as a light source,
%				that illuminates the local colour.  The local colour is specified in the
%				Munsell system, and the light reflecting off the local colour is analyzed
%				in terms of CIE coordinates.  The Y value is the percentage of light,
%				originally of an Illuminant C SPD, that the local colour reflects, 
%				measured in terms of the CIE standard observer.  The x and y chromaticity
%				coordinates can also be found for the reflected light.
%
%				The 1943 Munsell renotation ([Newhall1943]) expressed Munsell specifications
%				in terms of CIE coordinates.  The Munsell renotation was later updated
%				in [ASTMD1535-08].	Table I of [Newhall1943] lists CIE coordinates for
%				different combinations of H, V, and C.  The file all.dat from [MCSL2010]
%				extrapolates to further combinations, some of them imaginary.  For these samples, 
%				the conversion to xyY coordinates is a straightforward calculation.  The samples 
%				have integer value specifications, even chroma specifications, and hue
%				specifications prefixed by 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.  It is 
%				desired to find the xyY coordinates for Munsell specifications that are
%				intermediate to these samples.  This routine interpolates between xyY
%				coordinates for the available data samples, to find xyY coordinates for
%				Munsell specifications for which no renotation data is available.
%
%				The interpolation uses the empirically verified fact that the luminance factor
%				Y is a function solely of the Munsell value, and vice versa.  Therefore,
%				a Munsell section through a fixed value is mapped bijectively to the
%				chromaticity diagram for the corresponding luminance factor ([Newhall1943, Figs. 1 to 9]; 
%				reproduced with some modifications in [Agoston1987, Figs. 12.1 to 12.9]). 
%
%				The interpolation scheme first finds two Munsell colours of integer values
%				that bound the input Munsell colour immediately.  For example, 4B6.3/7 would
%				be bounded between 4B6/7 and 4B7/7.  The x and y coordinates of the
%				input Munsell colour are then found by linear interpolation on the x and y
%				coordinates of the bounding colours, over the luminance
%				factors.  The problem is thereby reduced to finding
%				x and y coordinates for Munsell colours of integer value, which is performed
%				by the routine MunsellToxyForIntegerMunsellValue.
%
%				For a detailed discussion and description of the interpolation algorithm,
%				see [Centore2011].
